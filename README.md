# Project Overview
## System Features:
During the development process, I implemented several core systems aimed at enriching gameplay functionality. These systems include a player controller, a straightforward dialogue system, a player inventory capable of equipping new skins, and a shop system. To ensure adaptability and scalability, I made a conscious effort to avoid establishing rigid connections between the canvas and other elements within the scene. Instead, I opted to utilize managers as intermediaries, fostering a modular design approach where components could function independently across separate scenes. This strategic decision not only facilitates future expansion but also offers flexibility in managing various aspects of the game's architecture. For instance, one could potentially isolate the canvas in its own scene while essential systems operate seamlessly in others, enhancing the project's overall robustness and maintainability.

## Thought Process:
Throughout the development phase, I prioritized maintaining a compact and straightforward scope to uphold the smooth functioning of gameplay systems. By focusing on essential features and avoiding unnecessary complexities, I aimed to ensure efficient resource allocation and mitigate the risk of feature creepâ€”a common challenge encountered in project development. This deliberate approach allowed for a more streamlined development process, fostering better project management and reducing the likelihood of encountering significant hurdles along the way.

## Personal Assessment:
Looking forward, should I choose to continue refining the project, my primary focus would be on enhancing its aesthetics to cultivate a more immersive and visually engaging experience for players. This endeavor would involve refining the visual style to ensure consistency across all game elements, thereby elevating the overall aesthetic appeal. Additionally, I would explore the possibility of segmenting the game world into distinct scenes to enhance organization and optimize performance. Moreover, I would dedicate time to improving UI aesthetics by integrating high-quality images, animations, and enhancing overall functionality to create a more polished and user-friendly interface. By addressing these aspects, I believe the project could reach its full potential and provide players with a more compelling and enjoyable gaming experience.
Moreover, in my personal assessment, I would also consider incorporating feedback from playtesting sessions to identify areas for improvement and refinement. By leveraging user insights, I can iteratively enhance gameplay mechanics and address any potential pain points, ensuring a more polished and enjoyable experience for players.
